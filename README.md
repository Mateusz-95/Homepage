## Description 

This is my first project during a programming course. Here my fascinating adventure begins! 

## What do I use in project:
- js code that switches the class of body
- some CSS stuff like alternative box model, arrengement of elements, normalize css, BEM convention, OpenGraph, icon
- general sense of aesthetics and selecting of colors on the site
